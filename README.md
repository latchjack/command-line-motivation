# Command Line Motivation

## Getting Started
If you would like to fork/clone this file to your own repository, please feel free to do so. 

You then need to run the `quotes.py` file in your CLI (i.e. Terminal, iTerm2) and the file will generate one of the random quotes from within the file.

e.g.
```console
  $ python quotes.py
```

To add quotes of your own open the file and in the quotes list enter your chosen quote using the following format...

```python
  quotes = [
    "\"Type your quote in here.\" - PersonWho SaidIt",
    "\"Type your quote in here.\" - PersonWho SaidIt",
    "\"Type your quote in here.\" - PersonWho SaidIt"
  ]
```
